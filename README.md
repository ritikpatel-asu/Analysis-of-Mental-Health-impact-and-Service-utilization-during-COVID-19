# Analysis-of-Mental-Health-impact-and-Service-utilization-during-COVID-19

Mental health care is a critical component of overall well-being, profoundly influencing quality of life and productivity. This project aims to analyze trends in mental health care usage over time, segmented by demographic groups. The study identifies patterns, disparities, and shifts in utilization rates, with a focus on uncovering correlations between mental health care indicators and demographic trends. These insights are intended to guide policy-making, inform public health strategies, and highlight areas requiring intervention to improve accessibility and equity in mental health care services.

By employing robust data analysis techniques, the project sheds light on how mental health care usage has evolved, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It explores disparities among demographic groups to inform stakeholders such as policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers, helping them optimize resource allocation and address inequities in mental health care services.

# Context

The importance of mental health care has grown significantly over the past decade due to its profound impact on individuals and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic further emphasized the urgent need for accessible and effective mental health services. During the pandemic, many individuals experienced heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, bringing mental health care access to the forefront of public discourse.

This project focuses on understanding the evolution of mental health care usage during and after the pandemic, analyzing trends across various demographic segments. By delving into patterns of mental health service utilization, this analysis seeks to uncover disparities and opportunities for intervention that can enhance the equity and accessibility of mental health care.

# Data Collection
The dataset used for this project, titled "Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks," provides valuable insights into mental health care usage patterns segmented by key demographic factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status.

# Key Dataset Features:
Time Period Start Date and End Date: Specifies the timeframe for data collection.
Value: Percentage of individuals utilizing mental health services during the given period.
LowCI and HighCI: Lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the reported values.
Group and Subgroup: Categorization based on demographic dimensions (e.g., age, gender).
Indicator: Identifies the specific mental health care metric measured (e.g., medication usage, counseling services).

# Data Preprocessing:
Before analysis, the dataset underwent meticulous preprocessing to ensure reliability and usability:
Missing values were imputed where necessary.
Date columns were standardized for consistent formatting.
Irrelevant records were excluded to focus on actionable insights.
The result is a clean, structured, and reliable dataset, ready for statistical modeling and visualization.

# Data Characteristics
The dataset’s structured nature enables comprehensive analysis, offering the following key characteristics:
Temporal Coverage
The data spans multiple time periods, providing the foundation for time-series analysis and allowing the identification of trends and shifts in mental health care usage.
Demographic Segmentation
Data is segmented by age, gender, and education level, enabling subgroup-specific analysis to uncover disparities and patterns across different demographics.
Quantitative Variables
Key numerical variables such as "Value," "LowCI," and "HighCI" enable statistical interpretation and confidence interval analysis.
Categorical Variables
Features such as "Group" and "Indicator" allow demographic stratification and detailed subgroup analysis, providing insights into the impact of various factors on mental health care usage.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To uncover meaningful insights, extensive EDA was conducted on the dataset. Key visualizations include:
Line Charts: To depict trends in mental health care usage over time.
Heatmaps: To visualize disparities across demographic groups.
Box Plots: To compare distributions and identify outliers among subgroups.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
Identify Usage Patterns: Analyze trends in mental health care usage over time.
Uncover Disparities: Highlight differences in utilization rates among demographic groups.
Guide Policy-Making: Provide actionable insights to policymakers and healthcare providers to improve equity and accessibility in mental health care services.
Address Gaps in Accessibility: Highlight areas requiring intervention to bridge disparities in mental health care utilization.

# Significance
This project’s findings hold significant implications for public health strategies and mental health care policies. By uncovering disparities and shifts in mental health care usage, the analysis aims to:
Enable targeted interventions for underserved groups.
Guide resource allocation to improve access to mental health services.
Foster a deeper understanding of the demographic factors influencing mental health care utilization.
